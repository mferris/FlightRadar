# Samples the kiosk's memory footprint so a slow leak is visible as a curve
# rather than as a frozen screen somebody happens to walk past.
#
# Written after Chromium's GPU command buffer failed to allocate on this
# device (see the watchdog in wake-listener.py). By the time it failed, the
# browser was holding 2.1GB of shared memory across 1,011 shm/memfd mappings;
# a restart returned it to 330MB. What grows, and how fast, is the open
# question -- so this records the pieces that would answer it: total shared
# memory, the /dev/shm arena the transfer buffers come from, and RSS plus
# shared-memory footprint broken out per Chromium process type, since a leak
# in the renderer and a leak in the GPU process point at different causes.
#
# TWO BUGS IN v1, BOTH OF WHICH MADE A RUNNING LEAK LOOK FIXED:
#
#   1. It sampled the FIRST process of each type. Chromium runs more than one
#      renderer, and for 308 consecutive samples this picked the idle one --
#      reporting renderer_maps=10, flat as a board, while the other renderer
#      climbed to 776 mappings and 1.5GB. A flat column was read as proof the
#      leak was gone. Every type is now summed across every process of that
#      type, and n_renderers is recorded so a changing process count cannot
#      masquerade as a changing footprint.
#
#   2. It recorded mapping COUNTS but not BYTES. The leak is 2MB blocks, so
#      counts and bytes happen to track here -- but a pool that grows its
#      blocks rather than its block count would be invisible. Both are logged.
#
# attributed_pct is the check that can fail: the shared memory this probe
# attributes to Chromium, over the kernel's system-wide Shmem. If the leak is
# inside a process this probe is looking at, that number stays high. If it
# drops while Shmem climbs, the growth has moved somewhere the probe cannot
# see -- and the flat per-process columns mean nothing, which is exactly the
# failure mode above.
#
# Deliberately cheap: one pass over a handful of /proc files every few
# minutes, on a Pi that is already thermally tight. The GPU error count is
# scoped to the last interval rather than the whole boot so the journal is
# not re-scanned from the beginning on every sample.
#
