# "The intersection must be empty" is the obvious test and it is wrong here.
# Wherever two parts share a surface -- which is the entire point of the
# colour split, since the toes sit in the pads and the tip continues the
# tail -- a boolean leaves a zero-thickness film along that boundary. Those
# films have thousands of facets and no volume. Judging by facet count calls
# a correct model broken; judging by volume separates a real interference
# from an artifact of two surfaces meeting exactly.
