# FlightWall — Handoff Notes

## Status
`index.html` is a matured version of `docs/original-prototype.html` that renders
**live** aircraft on the round radar instead of the fake demo data. It has been
tested against the real receiver at `http://192.168.4.77/tar1090/` and confirmed
working: live positions, altitude-coded colors, smooth interpolation between
1s polls, a "NO SIGNAL" banner on connection loss (tested by killing the feed),
and clean recovery on reconnect.

It is now **deployed and running on the Pi** (`[hostname-redacted]`, `192.168.4.77`,
user `mferris`) as a Chromium kiosk launched by systemd, verified to survive a
full reboot with no manual intervention.

## Display center override
`index.html` has a `HOME_OVERRIDE` constant that, when set, centers the
radar/map/runway lookup on a fixed point instead of the receiver's real
position — deliberately **display-only**, never touching `readsb`'s actual
configured position (`/etc/default/readsb`, `--lat`/`--lon`), which needs to
stay accurate to the real antenna for its own signal-range/MLAT math.

**Currently `null`** — back to auto-detecting the real receiver position
from `receiver.json` (confirmed to be **[address redacted]** — its
geocoded coordinates, [lat-redacted]/[lon-redacted], match readsb's configured
~[lat-redacted]/[lon-redacted] to within normal geocoding precision). It was briefly set to
[address redacted], Durham NC for a one-off request, then reverted.

If it's ever set again: `loadHome()` skips fetching `receiver.json` and uses
the override synchronously instead, and `normalizeAircraft()` always
computes bearing/range via haversine from raw lat/lon rather than trusting
readsb's precomputed `r_dst`/`r_dir` — those are relative to the *real*
antenna position, not an override point, and would silently produce a
geometrically-inconsistent display if trusted while overridden. (Verified by
hand while it was active: an aircraft readsb reported `r_dst: 3.77` for
showed up correctly as `14.53` in FlightWall — its true haversine range from
the override point.) Also worth knowing: a override point far from the real
antenna shifts the visible 40nm disc so it only partially overlaps the
antenna's actual reception area.

## Remote access (Tailscale Funnel)
The page is also reachable from outside the local network at
**https://[funnel-hostname-redacted]/** via Tailscale Funnel — publicly
reachable HTTPS, no login/app required for whoever you send the link to, no
router port-forwarding involved. `tailscale` is installed on the Pi, signed
into `mferris`'s tailnet, with `tailscale funnel --bg 80` proxying that
public URL to lighttpd on `127.0.0.1:80` (the same server `index.html` and
`/tar1090/` are already deployed to, so this is the exact same page, not a
separate copy). Funnel exposes the **whole** site, not just `index.html` —
`/tar1090/` itself is also reachable at that URL, fine for this use case
since it's just flight data, but worth remembering before deploying anything
more sensitive to this docroot later.
- Check status: `ssh mferris@192.168.4.77 tailscale funnel status`
- Turn off: `ssh mferris@192.168.4.77 sudo tailscale funnel --https=443 off`
- The Funnel/serve config is stored in tailscaled's persistent state, so it
  should come back automatically on reboot (not yet verified with an actual
  reboot test the way the kiosk service was — worth confirming if this
  matters going forward).

### Hardening done after enabling Funnel
Turning Funnel on prompted a quick look at what else was reachable on the
Pi. Two things worth knowing:
- **readsb's raw/Beast/SBS ports (30001-30005, 30104) are now bound to
  `127.0.0.1` only** (`--net-bind-address 127.0.0.1` added to `NET_OPTIONS`
  in `/etc/default/readsb`, original backed up alongside as
  `readsb.bak`). They used to listen on `0.0.0.0` — reachable from the whole
  LAN — but nothing on the network was actually connected to them, and
  FlightWall/tar1090 don't use them at all (they read the JSON files readsb
  writes to disk, not these TCP ports). If you ever want to feed a live raw
  feed to another device on your LAN (Virtual Radar Server, a second
  receiver dashboard, etc.), you'll need to revert this
  (`sudo cp /etc/default/readsb.bak /etc/default/readsb && sudo systemctl
  restart readsb`).
- **Deliberately left `mferris`'s passwordless sudo as-is.** Requiring a
  password would block the non-interactive SSH commands this whole project's
  deployment workflow depends on. This is a real trade-off, not an
  oversight — revisit if that workflow ever changes (e.g. moving deploys to
  a proper CI pipeline instead of ad-hoc SSH).
- **Network segmentation (Eero guest network) was suggested but not done**
  — the Pi's on `wlan0` (WiFi, not Ethernet), so Eero's guest network
  feature would apply cleanly, but doing this yourself: it isolates the Pi
  from the rest of the LAN, which also means your other devices lose
  ad-hoc local access to `http://192.168.4.77/` — Tailscale (already set up
  for Funnel) would keep working as the way to reach the Pi afterward,
  network-topology-independent.

The radar also now has a **background map** (MapLibre GL JS, vendored under
`vendor/` — BSD-3-Clause, v5.24.0, self-hosted so the only runtime network
dependency is the tile/style fetch itself). The map is non-interactive
(`interactive: false`), centered on `home`, and zoomed so its visible extent
matches the radar's `RANGE_NM` ring exactly (`zoomForRange()` in
`index.html` derives the zoom level from the standard Web Mercator
meters-per-pixel formula — recomputes correctly if `RANGE_NM` or the
receiver location ever changes, nothing hardcoded). Requires the Pi to have
internet access for tiles (confirmed working); the ADS-B tracking itself has
no such dependency and keeps working if the map layer fails to load (falls
back to the original solid dark background via CSS).

**Style is OpenFreeMap's `liberty`**, not their `dark` style — `dark` turned
out to be near-grayscale by design (checked the actual style JSON: water,
parks, and woods are all defined at ~0% saturation), so no amount of CSS
`saturate()` could pull color out of it. `liberty` has real color (blue
water, green parks, warm orange/yellow road tones) which we darken ourselves
via `#mapbg`'s CSS `filter: brightness(0.3) saturate(1.5)` — tuned live in a
few iterations to land on "still reads as a dark backdrop" without going all
the way back to washed-out or invisible. Since `liberty` is styled for a
light background (place-name labels are black text with a white halo),
`recolorLabels()` flips city/town/village/water-name labels to light
text/dark halo after the style loads, via the same `setPaintProperty`
pattern already used for the runway layer colors — otherwise the labels
would darken along with everything else and become illegible.

The map also shows **real runway outlines** at airports in range (e.g. RDU's
crossing-runway pattern). The OpenFreeMap tileset's own `aeroway-*` layers
turned out to be a dead end — confirmed via `queryRenderedFeatures()` that the
vector tiles simply carry no runway/taxiway geometry below zoom ~11, and our
fixed radar zoom is ~9.7, so raising the style's `minzoom` did nothing (the
data isn't in the tile, not just hidden). Runways instead come from a
one-time query to OSM's public Overpass API (`loadRunways()`, fired once from
`map.on('load', ...)` since the receiver's home location never changes at
runtime), added as our own GeoJSON source/layers — this bypasses the vector
tileset's zoom restriction entirely since a GeoJSON source isn't tile-paginated.
Purely additive: if Overpass is unreachable the map/radar work exactly as
before, just without runway outlines.

Each tracked aircraft now shows a **color-coded airline badge** (full name,
e.g. "Piedmont Airlines" — or "Private Aircraft" for GA/unidentified flights),
a **human-readable aircraft type** (e.g. "Bombardier Regional Jet CRJ-900",
"Bell 429 GlobalRanger"), and its **route** as city names (e.g. "Tampa →
London") when one's known. A few deliberate choices here, worth preserving:
- **No real airline logos.** They're trademarked, and this project is meant
  to be published under MIT — bundling them would ship trademarked assets in
  an openly-redistributable repo. The `AIRLINES` table in `index.html` instead
  has a small hand-picked set of ICAO designators (ICAO Doc 8585, a public
  standard) mapped to a full name/IATA code/loosely-associated color, rendered
  as a generated text badge. Not exhaustive — unmapped carriers just fall
  back to the airline's ICAO code not being in the table (rare); anything
  whose callsign doesn't match the airline-flight-number pattern at all
  (`/^[A-Z]{3}\d/`) gets "Private Aircraft" instead.
- **Route data comes from `https://adsb.im/api/0/routeset`** — the same free,
  no-key API `tar1090` itself already uses on this Pi (confirmed by reading
  `planeObject_*.js`'s `routeDoLookup()` on the box). ADS-B itself carries no
  route info at all. Lookups are batched/cached/throttled in `index.html`
  (`queueRouteLookup`/`flushRouteQueue`) the same way tar1090 does it: one
  POST per `ROUTE_BATCH_MS` (4s), results cached for the rest of the session
  (including negative "no route found" results, so unknown callsigns aren't
  re-queried every cycle). Routes the API itself flags `plausible: false` are
  treated as unknown rather than displayed (tar1090 doesn't bother with this
  check, but showing a route the API itself doubts felt worse than omitting
  it). Displays city names (`_airports[].location`) rather than IATA codes.
- **Aircraft type also has no field in `aircraft.json`** — readsb doesn't
  populate `t`/`desc` there. tar1090 solves this the same way it solves
  routes: a local same-origin database, this time already sitting on the Pi
  as a prefix-trie of small JSON shards under `/tar1090/db-<hash>/` (the hash
  changes whenever tar1090's assets rebuild, so `index.html` discovers the
  current folder name at runtime by regexing it out of `/tar1090/index.html`
  rather than hardcoding it — see `discoverDatabaseFolder()`). `lookupType()`
  walks that trie itself (own implementation, not copied — tar1090's own code
  license is unclear ["Other"/NOASSERTION on GitHub], so this reads the same
  public same-origin data files but isn't a port of their `dbloader.js`).
  Falls back to `icao_aircraft_types2.js` (ICAO type-code -> description) when
  a specific tail's entry has no `typeLong` of its own. `humanizeType()` just
  re-cases ALL-CAPS manufacturer names ("CIRRUS SR-22" -> "Cirrus SR-22")
  without touching model numbers.

**Labels live in a ring around the edge of the dial**, not floating next to
their plane — each label's natural position is its own bearing angle
(`LABEL_RING_RADIUS = R + 60`), eased there via `LABEL_SPRING_TAU` as the
plane moves, and a color-matched SVG leader line (`#leaders`) always
connects the label back to its actual plane position (attached to whichever
edge of the box faces the plane, via `closestPointOnRect()`). Overlap
resolution (`LABEL_SEPARATION_PASSES` iterations) only ever adjusts a
label's *angle* along the ring, never pulls it off — and always resolves
bearing-adjacent neighbors in bearing-sorted cyclic order. That order
preservation is what guarantees leader lines never cross (a standard
property: connecting points on an inner circle to points on an outer ring
in the same cyclic order can't produce crossing chords), not just an
approximation of "minimized." `R` was shrunk from `0.44*W` to `0.38*W` to
free up a real outer band for the ring to live in. One known rough edge:
a label very close to due-north bearing can lightly touch the HUD text at
the top of the stage — rare, and it's a HUD/label interaction rather than
label-on-label overlap, but not yet fixed. This replaced an earlier
version that eased each label toward a fixed offset next to its plane with
plain 2D AABB separation — that avoided label-on-label overlap fine but had
no concept of leader-line crossings at all.

Covers milestones 3–4, 6, and part of 7 from `docs/project-spec.md`. Not done
yet: milestone 5 (optional tap detail panel), and physically mounting/connecting
the round panel (see below).

## Key facts learned this session
- Receiver home location comes from `http://192.168.4.77/tar1090/data/receiver.json`
  (`lat`/`lon`) — the app fetches this itself at startup rather than hardcoding it.
  Currently ~[lat-redacted]°N, [lon-redacted]°W (Raleigh-Durham area).
- `aircraft.json` entries already include `r_dst` (range, nm) and `r_dir` (bearing,
  deg) precomputed by readsb relative to the receiver — `index.html` uses these
  directly and only falls back to a haversine calc from raw `lat`/`lon` if they're
  ever missing.
- The Pi's web server (lighttpd) does **not** send CORS headers, so `index.html`
  must be deployed same-origin (i.e. copied onto the Pi itself, served from the
  same host as `/tar1090/`) — it uses relative fetch paths (`/tar1090/data/...`)
  for exactly this reason.
- SSH login is `mferris@192.168.4.77` (not `pi` — that user doesn't exist on this
  image). Passwordless sudo is configured for `mferris`.
- The Pi runs full Raspberry Pi OS (Debian 13 "trixie") with a Wayland desktop
  (`labwc` compositor, `rpd-labwc` session), lightdm with autologin already
  configured for `mferris`. Not a Lite/headless image.
- The round display was **not physically connected** during this session (both
  HDMI ports read `disconnected` via `/sys/class/drm/*/status`) — the compositor
  falls back to a virtual/no-op 1920x1080 output. Everything was verified via
  `grim` screenshots of that virtual output; the app has not yet been visually
  confirmed on the real 1080x1080 round panel.

## Deployment (milestone 6 — done)
- `index.html` lives at `/var/www/html/index.html` on the Pi (root-owned,
  lighttpd's docroot), served at `http://localhost/` — same-origin with
  `/tar1090/`, satisfying the CORS constraint above.
- Kiosk launcher is a **systemd user service**, checked into this repo at
  `deploy/flightwall-kiosk.service` and deployed to
  `~/.config/systemd/user/flightwall-kiosk.service` on the Pi (as `mferris`).
  - Launches `chromium --kiosk ... http://localhost/index.html`
  - `ExecStartPre` waits (up to 60s) for a `wayland-*` socket in
    `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` before starting Chromium — needed because the compositor
    isn't up yet at the instant lightdm opens the session. **Important:** don't
    wait on the `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` env var itself (e.g.
    `-S "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY"`) — that variable is imported into
    the systemd user manager *after* labwc starts, so a process forked right at
    session-open captures it empty and waits forever. Glob for `wayland-*[0-9]`
    instead.
  - `Restart=always`, `RestartSec=5` for crash recovery.
  - Enabled via `systemctl --user enable` (symlinked into
    `default.target.wants`), plus `sudo loginctl enable-linger mferris` so the
    user's systemd instance starts at boot even before an interactive login
    completes.
- Verified with an actual `sudo reboot`: service came up ~30s after boot with
  zero restarts, no manual login needed, and was rendering live traffic.
- To redeploy `index.html` after future edits:
  `scp index.html mferris@192.168.4.77:/tmp/ && ssh mferris@192.168.4.77 'sudo cp /tmp/index.html /var/www/html/index.html && rm /tmp/index.html'`
  (Chromium will pick it up on next reload/kiosk restart — no service restart
  needed unless the launch flags/URL change.)

## Open — not yet done
- **Milestone 5** (optional): tap-an-aircraft detail panel.
- **Physical verification on the real panel**: the round 1080x1080 display
  needs to actually be connected via HDMI to confirm rendering, sizing, and
  touch input work on real hardware — not yet possible since it isn't wired up
  in the enclosure yet.

## Dev-only files
`dev-server.py` is a local-only static file server + reverse proxy
(`/tar1090/*` → `192.168.4.77`) used purely to test `index.html` with the same
relative paths it'll use in production, without hitting CORS on a dev machine.
It is **not** part of the deployed app — don't copy it to the Pi. Run it with
`python3 dev-server.py` and open `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.
