# FlightWall — Handoff Notes

## Status
`index.html` is a matured version of `docs/original-prototype.html` that renders
**live** aircraft on the round radar instead of the fake demo data. It has been
tested against the real receiver at `http://192.168.4.77/tar1090/` and confirmed
working: live positions, altitude-coded colors, smooth interpolation between
1s polls, a "NO SIGNAL" banner on connection loss (tested by killing the feed),
and clean recovery on reconnect.

It is now **deployed and running on the Pi** (`flightwall`, `192.168.4.77`,
user `mferris`) as a Chromium kiosk launched by systemd, verified to survive a
full reboot with no manual intervention.

The radar also now has a **dark background map** (MapLibre GL JS, vendored
under `vendor/` — BSD-3-Clause, v5.24.0, self-hosted so the only runtime
network dependency is the tile/style fetch itself). Style is OpenFreeMap's
free hosted `dark` style (`https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/dark`), no
API key needed. The map is non-interactive (`interactive: false`), centered
on the receiver's home location, and zoomed so its visible extent matches the
radar's `RANGE_NM` ring exactly (`zoomForRange()` in `index.html` derives the
zoom level from the standard Web Mercator meters-per-pixel formula — recomputes
correctly if `RANGE_NM` or the receiver location ever changes, nothing
hardcoded). Dimmed via a CSS `filter` on `#mapbg` so it stays a backdrop, not
competing with the amber blips/rings. Requires the Pi to have internet access
for tiles (confirmed working); the ADS-B tracking itself has no such
dependency and keeps working if the map layer fails to load (falls back to
the original solid dark background via CSS).

The map also shows **real runway outlines** at airports in range (e.g. RDU's
crossing-runway pattern). The OpenFreeMap tileset's own `aeroway-*` layers
turned out to be a dead end — confirmed via `queryRenderedFeatures()` that the
vector tiles simply carry no runway/taxiway geometry below zoom ~11, and our
fixed radar zoom is ~9.7, so raising the style's `minzoom` did nothing (the
data isn't in the tile, not just hidden). Runways instead come from a
one-time query to OSM's public Overpass API (`loadRunways()`, fired once from
`map.on('load', ...)` since the receiver's home location never changes at
runtime), added as our own GeoJSON source/layers — this bypasses the vector
tileset's zoom restriction entirely since a GeoJSON source isn't tile-paginated.
Purely additive: if Overpass is unreachable the map/radar work exactly as
before, just without runway outlines.

Each tracked aircraft now shows a **color-coded airline badge** (full name,
e.g. "Piedmont Airlines" — or "Private Aircraft" for GA/unidentified flights),
a **human-readable aircraft type** (e.g. "Bombardier Regional Jet CRJ-900",
"Bell 429 GlobalRanger"), and its **route** as city names (e.g. "Tampa →
London") when one's known. A few deliberate choices here, worth preserving:
- **No real airline logos.** They're trademarked, and this project is meant
  to be published under MIT — bundling them would ship trademarked assets in
  an openly-redistributable repo. The `AIRLINES` table in `index.html` instead
  has a small hand-picked set of ICAO designators (ICAO Doc 8585, a public
  standard) mapped to a full name/IATA code/loosely-associated color, rendered
  as a generated text badge. Not exhaustive — unmapped carriers just fall
  back to the airline's ICAO code not being in the table (rare); anything
  whose callsign doesn't match the airline-flight-number pattern at all
  (`/^[A-Z]{3}\d/`) gets "Private Aircraft" instead.
- **Route data comes from `https://adsb.im/api/0/routeset`** — the same free,
  no-key API `tar1090` itself already uses on this Pi (confirmed by reading
  `planeObject_*.js`'s `routeDoLookup()` on the box). ADS-B itself carries no
  route info at all. Lookups are batched/cached/throttled in `index.html`
  (`queueRouteLookup`/`flushRouteQueue`) the same way tar1090 does it: one
  POST per `ROUTE_BATCH_MS` (4s), results cached for the rest of the session
  (including negative "no route found" results, so unknown callsigns aren't
  re-queried every cycle). Routes the API itself flags `plausible: false` are
  treated as unknown rather than displayed (tar1090 doesn't bother with this
  check, but showing a route the API itself doubts felt worse than omitting
  it). Displays city names (`_airports[].location`) rather than IATA codes.
- **Aircraft type also has no field in `aircraft.json`** — readsb doesn't
  populate `t`/`desc` there. tar1090 solves this the same way it solves
  routes: a local same-origin database, this time already sitting on the Pi
  as a prefix-trie of small JSON shards under `/tar1090/db-<hash>/` (the hash
  changes whenever tar1090's assets rebuild, so `index.html` discovers the
  current folder name at runtime by regexing it out of `/tar1090/index.html`
  rather than hardcoding it — see `discoverDatabaseFolder()`). `lookupType()`
  walks that trie itself (own implementation, not copied — tar1090's own code
  license is unclear ["Other"/NOASSERTION on GitHub], so this reads the same
  public same-origin data files but isn't a port of their `dbloader.js`).
  Falls back to `icao_aircraft_types2.js` (ICAO type-code -> description) when
  a specific tail's entry has no `typeLong` of its own. `humanizeType()` just
  re-cases ALL-CAPS manufacturer names ("CIRRUS SR-22" -> "Cirrus SR-22")
  without touching model numbers.

Tags are now much taller (badge/type/route rows), so **label overlap is
solved with real collision avoidance**, not just fixed offsets. Each plane's
tag eases toward a spot next to it (`LABEL_SPRING_TAU`) but a hard AABB
separation pass (`LABEL_SEPARATION_PASSES` iterations) pushes any two
overlapping boxes apart every frame, and a thin color-matched SVG line
(`#leaders`) always connects each tag back to its actual plane position —
see the "pass 1-4" comments in `drawPlanes()`. Stress-tested with 14
synthetic aircraft crammed into a ~4nm cluster (via `applyUpdate()` in the
browser console) and it cleanly fans them out with zero overlap. This is a
from-scratch simple physics relaxation (spring + AABB push-apart), not
copied from anywhere — a generic, well-known technique.

Covers milestones 3–4, 6, and part of 7 from `docs/project-spec.md`. Not done
yet: milestone 5 (optional tap detail panel), and physically mounting/connecting
the round panel (see below).

## Key facts learned this session
- Receiver home location comes from `http://192.168.4.77/tar1090/data/receiver.json`
  (`lat`/`lon`) — the app fetches this itself at startup rather than hardcoding it.
  Currently ~[lat-redacted]°N, [lon-redacted]°W (Raleigh-Durham area).
- `aircraft.json` entries already include `r_dst` (range, nm) and `r_dir` (bearing,
  deg) precomputed by readsb relative to the receiver — `index.html` uses these
  directly and only falls back to a haversine calc from raw `lat`/`lon` if they're
  ever missing.
- The Pi's web server (lighttpd) does **not** send CORS headers, so `index.html`
  must be deployed same-origin (i.e. copied onto the Pi itself, served from the
  same host as `/tar1090/`) — it uses relative fetch paths (`/tar1090/data/...`)
  for exactly this reason.
- SSH login is `mferris@192.168.4.77` (not `pi` — that user doesn't exist on this
  image). Passwordless sudo is configured for `mferris`.
- The Pi runs full Raspberry Pi OS (Debian 13 "trixie") with a Wayland desktop
  (`labwc` compositor, `rpd-labwc` session), lightdm with autologin already
  configured for `mferris`. Not a Lite/headless image.
- The round display was **not physically connected** during this session (both
  HDMI ports read `disconnected` via `/sys/class/drm/*/status`) — the compositor
  falls back to a virtual/no-op 1920x1080 output. Everything was verified via
  `grim` screenshots of that virtual output; the app has not yet been visually
  confirmed on the real 1080x1080 round panel.

## Deployment (milestone 6 — done)
- `index.html` lives at `/var/www/html/index.html` on the Pi (root-owned,
  lighttpd's docroot), served at `http://localhost/` — same-origin with
  `/tar1090/`, satisfying the CORS constraint above.
- Kiosk launcher is a **systemd user service**, checked into this repo at
  `deploy/flightwall-kiosk.service` and deployed to
  `~/.config/systemd/user/flightwall-kiosk.service` on the Pi (as `mferris`).
  - Launches `chromium --kiosk ... http://localhost/index.html`
  - `ExecStartPre` waits (up to 60s) for a `wayland-*` socket in
    `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` before starting Chromium — needed because the compositor
    isn't up yet at the instant lightdm opens the session. **Important:** don't
    wait on the `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` env var itself (e.g.
    `-S "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY"`) — that variable is imported into
    the systemd user manager *after* labwc starts, so a process forked right at
    session-open captures it empty and waits forever. Glob for `wayland-*[0-9]`
    instead.
  - `Restart=always`, `RestartSec=5` for crash recovery.
  - Enabled via `systemctl --user enable` (symlinked into
    `default.target.wants`), plus `sudo loginctl enable-linger mferris` so the
    user's systemd instance starts at boot even before an interactive login
    completes.
- Verified with an actual `sudo reboot`: service came up ~30s after boot with
  zero restarts, no manual login needed, and was rendering live traffic.
- To redeploy `index.html` after future edits:
  `scp index.html mferris@192.168.4.77:/tmp/ && ssh mferris@192.168.4.77 'sudo cp /tmp/index.html /var/www/html/index.html && rm /tmp/index.html'`
  (Chromium will pick it up on next reload/kiosk restart — no service restart
  needed unless the launch flags/URL change.)

## Open — not yet done
- **Milestone 5** (optional): tap-an-aircraft detail panel.
- **Physical verification on the real panel**: the round 1080x1080 display
  needs to actually be connected via HDMI to confirm rendering, sizing, and
  touch input work on real hardware — not yet possible since it isn't wired up
  in the enclosure yet.

## Dev-only files
`dev-server.py` is a local-only static file server + reverse proxy
(`/tar1090/*` → `192.168.4.77`) used purely to test `index.html` with the same
relative paths it'll use in production, without hitting CORS on a dev machine.
It is **not** part of the deployed app — don't copy it to the Pi. Run it with
`python3 dev-server.py` and open `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.
